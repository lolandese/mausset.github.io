## Agriturismo in the Heart of Nature in Val Pellice

We decided to offer hospitality to put this unspoiled place at the disposal of people who love and respect Nature, and to overcome our inability to travel due to our animals, thus also having the opportunity to meet people and organizations with whom to exchange experiences.

### Ecological Structures

Guests will have access to spaces built with local materials such as stone and wood, completely renovated and powered by photovoltaic systems. The roofs are insulated with wood fiber that ensures insulation while allowing the spaces to "breathe," while the double-chamber windows limit temperature fluctuations. Latex beds and silence ensure a good night's sleep.

For cooking, in addition to modern gas and electric kitchens, there are also economical wood-burning kitchens (poutagè). Drinking water comes from a spring source, while rainwater collection contributes to irrigation.

### Our Approach

Respect for nature and conscious use of mountain resources form the basis of our philosophy and is what we ask of our guests.

Guests who wish can participate in farm activities:
- Animal husbandry and management
- Observation of milk transformation phases
- Vegetable garden management and preservation of harvested agricultural products
- Occasional bread-making

Otherwise, they can enjoy a relaxing stay in complete privacy, lulled by birdsong or the tinkling of grazing animals.

### Group Activities

We also welcome groups wishing to use the spaces for specific courses, for example:
- Astronomy (we have a magnificent sky undisturbed by nearby light sources)
- Painting
- Cooking
- Herbalism
- Yoga
- Wool processing (felting)
- And many others

We are available to share the knowledge we have acquired over many years of living in contact with Nature.
