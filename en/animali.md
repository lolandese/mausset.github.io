## Agriturismo with Animals: Goats, Sheep, Ducks, Geese and Chickens

### The Goats

Our goats all have a name, a strong personality and produce delicious milk. We started over 25 years ago with local goats crossed with a Saanen buck, obtaining a hardy and productive breed.

They produce milk from February to October, the months in which we make cheese. We follow the natural course of the seasons, observing the natural rest period (dry) because we do not wish to condition them artificially.

The goats are the heart of the farm and are part of the history and identity of Mausset. Many guests return precisely to greet the goats who have by then become familiar with them!

### Frabosane Sheep

We raise about ten Frabosane sheep for the production of breeding lambs and meat. They follow the same natural rhythm as the goats and contribute to maintaining the ecological balance of the farm.

### Ducks, Geese and Chickens

Ducks, geese and chickens keep us company, provide us with eggs, meat and happily consume the scraps from our garden, contributing to the sustainable cycle of the farm.

### Companion Dogs and Cats

Companion dogs and cats complete the animal park of the village, making the atmosphere even more welcoming and family-like for guests.

### The Philosophy of Our Animal Husbandry

All animals at Mausset are raised according to natural and sustainable criteria. We do not impose artificial rhythms, but respect natural biological cycles. The animals have ample space to graze and move freely, living a life as natural as possible.
