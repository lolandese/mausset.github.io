When you arrive at Villar Pellice, you pass in front of the Town Hall and continue straight past the Waldensian Temple, taking **Via Indritto**.

Continue for about 3 km, always keeping to the left on the asphalt and following the sign **"Maussa"**.

After crossing a ford, you arrive at **Borgata Palet**, from where a dirt road branches off, marked with a wooden sign **"Goat Cheeses"**.
