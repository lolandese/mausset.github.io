# Welcome to Borgata Maussa

## Ecological Agriturismo in Val Pellice

Arrive as guests – leave as friends.

Would you like to spend the most beautiful days of your year in a welcoming agriturismo suitable for singles, families and groups of all ages? You will feel at home here with us!

Our fully renovated agriturismo is located in a quiet valley of Val Pellice at the edge of the forest. Mausset promotes simple and ecological tourism, where the key word is **self-management**: there are no cooks, waiters, or cleaning staff. During your stay you can use the kitchens and prepare your meals using our farm products.

While adults can relax in the garden or admire the stunning panorama, children have plenty of space to play safely. Nadine, Diana, Elena, Roberta and the goats are happy to welcome you!
