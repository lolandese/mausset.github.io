## Vegetable Garden, Orchard, Homemade Bread, Preserves and Exquisite Cheeses

### From Abandoned Village to Welcoming Refuge

Around the 1960s the hamlet was definitively abandoned, remaining uninhabited for about fifteen years when Gianfranco decided to raise bees in the mountains, where his grandparents lived.

In the early 1980s he met Roberta with whom he later formed his family. Three children were born and together they dedicated themselves to raising bees, farm animals and goats, as well as cultivating gardens and small orchards with traditional methods without the use of chemical products.

By selling their products they were able, little by little, to purchase the entire hamlet with the desire to revive this place. They learned to make bread, restoring the old oven, to preserve wild fruits and vegetables of their own production, to make cheese with the milk from their own goats.

### The Present

Now Gianfranco is gone, having passed away prematurely. Here we are: Roberta, Ben, Nadine with Diana and Elena and occasionally Sole.

The battle to preserve the village continues, with the commitment to keep alive the values that Gianfranco and Roberta built over the years: respect for nature, sustainability, authentic hospitality and the transmission of knowledge acquired through direct contact with the mountains and their natural cycles.

Mausset is today a place where the past meets the present, where rural tradition coexists with an ecological and conscious vision of the future.
