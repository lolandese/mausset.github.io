## Own Production of Goat Cheese and Yogurt

Mausset is a farm that produces raw milk goat cheese with grazing goats in the forests of Val Pellice. Our goats graze year-round, but produce milk from February to November.

### Our Cheeses

Currently the farm has about twenty dairy goats with which we produce:

- **"Ciabra 'd Moussa" (Goat of Maussa)** - Raw milk cheeses made with fresh and aged lactic curd
- **"Luna caprese"** - Raw milk cheese made with rennet curd that also allows us to make ricotta

Our cheeses are available:
