## <a name="webshop"></a>Independent one man webshop (2010 - 2018)
Produced around twenty websites ranging a € 2K to 10K  budget covering a variety of clients:

Most of the sites are now outdated or have ceased to exist. The last one I made (summer 2018) as independent webshop was [rarecare.world](https://rarecare.world).

Some others are still partially accessible through [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org):
- A site [representing a book](https://ssthistlegorm.com/en). (2014)
- A [publishing company](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008164549/http://www.geodia.net/en). (2012)
- Two [food retailers](http://web.archive.org/web/20160218064313/http://www.cookiesnpies.com:80/). (2013)
- A [casino](http://web.archive.org/web/20150716072347/http://www.sinaigrandcasino.com:80/en). (2012)

-  .. others.

Apart from Drupal 6, 7 and 8 web development other activities consisted of guidance on social media presence and management (Facebook) and Amazon Kindle publishing.

Obviously I am more focussed on architecture and Drupal development now but the above gives an impression of the evolution I went through in my early years. This experience gives me a better understanding of other skills like design and user experience.
